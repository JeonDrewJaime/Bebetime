        <p> I want you to know that you are my safe haven, my greatest adventure, and the person I want by my side through every twist and turn life may bring.</p> <br/>
       
        <p>I am ready to love even the parts of you that you might consider imperfect, and to embrace the chapters of your past that may feel shadowed, for they have shaped the extraordinary person you are today. </p> <br/>

        <p>Every moment with you teaches me something new about love, how it can heal, inspire, and transform. You have taught me patience, selflessness, and what it truly means to be seen and accepted for who I am. For that, I am eternally grateful.</p> <br/>

        <p>Thank you for being you. For being the person who inspires me, challenges me, and makes my heart so full it feels like it might burst. I promise to cherish you, to support you, and to love you fiercely every single day. </p> <br/>

        <p>Forever yours, Baby</p> <br/>
